    "### Conditionals \n",
    "\n",
    "Also know as if-else statements, these powerful built in python expressions are seen throughout other programming languages and are based off of the if-then statements in logic. With some interger value x, the following serves as the basic structure of conditional statements. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if x > 5:\n",
    "    return \"greater than 5\"\n",
    "elif x > 10:\n",
    "    return \"greater than 10\"\n",
    "...\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    return \"greater than everything\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "For the conditional statement above, python goes through the if expressions, i.e. `if x > 5`, `elif x > 10` and evaluates the first true statement. Python goes in order so it is important your logic is correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For a conditional, we always start off with `if (some expression is true)` and a conditional block only has one if. \n",
    "\n",
    "`elif` short for `else if` similar to `if` has the form `elif (some expression is true)`. If the first thing isn't true then elif statements check for other possibilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally after we have checked for the important possibilities, `else` is used as a last resort. If all the previous conditional statements do not evaluate to true, your conditional block will evaluate the `else` expression. \n"

In the `for loop` above, `number` is one item within the list called list_number. Python goes through each item in list_numbers, and each item is refered to as `number` but we can call it literally whatever. If we want to do something with the item in the list, i.e. `number`, we must call the variable and apply something to it like `print(number)`. `list_number` is just an example, but the value type that must go after `in` in the for loop must be either a list, array, or other iterable.
